Map & Tracking System

Please note:
This software is most advantageous to run when paired with the MATLAB open source code Library that accompanies it. 

Open software for RFID mapping and tracking.
This software allows users to map and track activity of a group of users and utilities, across an area.

This software turns a group of identifiers of a signal and signal alerts into a timestamp which can be continuously or singularity uploaded to the net.

These signals update a series of Objects which were initially created by the initializer files.
The objects in the file will allow users to create their own scheme or timeline to track the individuals across the area.

The inputs needed to run this program are initializer text files, and a constantly updating signal text file.

The initializer files needed are:

Activity (representing activities which can report signals across the area)			
int ID’String name’boolean Static’int Room ID
Mobile	(beings which can be targeted by Activities across the area)
int ID’String name			
Room	(if any rooms or areas in the studyied area)
int ID’String name’int inside_of_other_RoomID						
Transfer gate	(Usually referring to doors, stations Mobiles can use to change areas)			
int ID’String name’int roomAID’int roomBID

The file updated needs:
TIMESTAMP’(Activity or TransferGate ID)’Mobile ID

The information in the file will then be converted into an output which describes who did what at what time and where.

Thank you for reading this README written after a few days of restlessness.
